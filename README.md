# PyGeoCoderRev

Python reverse geo-coder for NCEDC-formatted comma-separated-value earthquake files.

## Synopsis

This project, as currently implemented, is intended to reverse-geocode NCEDC-formatted earthquake comma-separated-value (CSV) files.  Reverse-geocoding is the process of obtaining administrative units (e.g. country, state, county/province, city/village) from latitude and longitude (lat-long) coordinates.  With a modicum of effort, this program could be modified so as to reverse-geocode most any file or database table.

## Source(s) of Earthquake Data in CSV format

- [ANSS Composite Catalog Search](http://www.ncedc.org/anss/catalog-search.html)
  - Choose `Catalog in CSV format`
  - Enter `Start date,time` value with a comma separating the date (yyyy/MM/dd) and time (HH:mm:ss) value
  - Enter `End date,time` value with a comma separating the date (yyyy/MM/dd) and time (HH:mm:ss) value, leaving this blank to default to today's date, time value.
  - Enter `Minimum magnitude` value, recommended minimum value, especially for fracking research, is 2.0 or less
  - Leave `Maximum magnitude` blank so that all earthquakes above the `Minimum magnitude` will be included
  - Choose `Send output to an anonymous FTP file on the NCEDC` within the "Select output mechanism" section
  - Enter `10000000` in the `Line limit on output` box (i.e. 10,000,000 rows max)
  - Click on the `Submit request` button
  - On the "NCEDC_Search_Results" web page that appears after the `Submit request` button is pressed, wait until a `Url` link appears, right-click on it and click on the `Save link as...` sub-menu item, and save the file to a location of your choosing.
  - The saved file mentioned in the bullet above is the file to which you'll point the `GeoCoderRev.py` script when you invoke it to reverse-geocode the rows therein. 

## Invoking the `GeoCoderRev.py` program

- The simplest invocation of the program is as follows:
  - Navigate the folder holding the `PyGeoCoderRev` project.
  - Open a command terminal from within that folder
    - Windows: `Shift-Right-click` within the project's folder, choose `Open command window here`
    - Linux (Ubuntu with `nautilus-open-terminal` installed): `Right-click` within the project's folder, choose `Open terminal`
    - Linux (Ubuntu without `nautilus-open-terminal` installed): `Ctrl-Alt-T`, then navigate to the project's folder
  - Within the command terminal, enter the following command:
    - `python GeoCoderRev.py --src-file-path=/path/to/the/downloaded/NCEDC/earthquake/CSV/file --out-file-path=/path/to/the/resulting/reverse-geocoded/NCEDC/earthquake/CSV/file`
    
## Command-line arguments
    
The `GeoCoderRev.py` program has more command-line options than just the two shown in the example above, a quick explanation of them follows:
  
- `--src-file-path`: The path to the raw NCEDC-formatted earthquake source file in CSV format.
- `--src-delimiter`: The character that separates each value within the file. The default is a comma `,`.
- `--src-quotechar`: The character that surrounds each value within the file, should it contain a delimiter. The default is a double-quote `"`.
- `--src-quotemode`: The quoting mode, which defaults to `QUOTE_MINIMAL`.  Valid choices are `QUOTE_MINIMAL`, `QUOTE_NONE`, `QUOTE_ALL`, `QUOTE_NONNUMERIC`.
  
- `--out-file-path`: The path to the reverse-geocoded NCEDC-formatted earthquake output file in CSV format.
- `--out-delimiter`: The character that separates each value within the file. The default is a comma `,`.
- `--out-quotechar`: The character that surrounds each value within the file, should it contain a delimiter. The default is a double-quote `"`.
- `--out-quotemode`: The quoting mode, which defaults to `QUOTE_MINIMAL`.  Valid choices are `QUOTE_MINIMAL`, `QUOTE_NONE`, `QUOTE_ALL`, `QUOTE_NONNUMERIC`.
  
- `--max-rows`: Mostly intended to be used for testing purposes, this integer argument defaults to `0`, which means unlimited rows will be processed.  Any positive integer above zero will result in just that many rows being processed, for example `10` means only ten rows would be processed.
- `--flush-rows`: This integer value controls how often a progress message is output to the console as well as when any buffered rows are "flushed" to the output file.
- `-h` or `--help`: Specifying this argument will output command-line usage information to the console, which describes the command-line arguments for this program, and then terminates the program without any further processing.
